## Introduction
Janet provides infrastructure to build flexible, scalable and resilient 
architecture based on actions, `RxJava`-powered pipes and services to execute those actions.
  
Lets walk through common flow for http request: 

![overview](/assets/readme-overview.png)

* Janet is equipped with services to deal with different actions:
    ```java
    Janet janet = new Janet.Builder()
        .addService(new HttpActionService(API_URL, httpClient, converter))
        .addService(new SqlActionService(...))
        .addService(new XyzActionService(...))
        .build();
    ```
    
1. Our request is described with `SampleHttpAction` class:
    ```java
    @HttpAction(value = "/demo", method = GET)
    public class SampleHttpAction {
        @Response SampleData responseData;
    }
    ```
    
    Request is sent/observed with it's `ActionPipe`:
    ```java
    // create pipe for action class with janet
    ActionPipe<SampleHttpAction> actionPipe = janet.createPipe(SampleHttpAction.class);
    
    // register request result observer
    actionPipe.observe().subscribe(new ActionStateSubscriber<SampleHttpAction>()
        .onStart(action -> System.out.println("Request is being sent " + action))
        .onProgress((action, progress) -> System.out.println("Request in progress: " + progress))
        .onSuccess(action -> System.out.println("Request finished " + action))
        .onFail((action, throwable) -> System.err.println("Request failed " + throwable))
    );
    
    // send request
    actionPipe.send(new SampleHttpAction());
    // or actionPipe.createObservable(new SampleHttpAction()).subscribe(...) 
    ```
2. Request is forwarded to `Janet` instance upon `send` or `subscribe` call;
3. `Janet` finds suitable service to execute action and routes to it;
4. `ActionService` knows how to deal with action and sets up `progress`/`success`/`fail` statuses;
5. Resulting action is brought back to `Janet` instance;
6. `Janet` routes resulting action with status to dedicated pipes;
7. Dedicated `ActionPipe` notifies all it's observers of action wrapped with current status;

So `Janet` instance itself stands for routing, delegating diff job to other components:

* `ActionPipe` – action operator, the only way to send action and receive result;
* `ActionService` – knows how to deal with action;
* `ActionServiceWrapper` – decorator to put additional logic for underlying service;

### Available services
Janet abilities depends on services.
Currently there are:

* [HttpActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-http) to provide HTTP/HTTPS requests execution;
* [AsyncActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-async) to provide support for async protocols, e.g. [socket.io](http://socket.io/);
* [CommandActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-command) to delegate job back to command `action`.
   
Possible solutions: 
`SqlActionService`, `LocationActionService`, `BillingActionService`, etc.

## Components
### ActionPipe
The only way to operate with `action` – via it's `ActionPipe`.
It's created for particular action class:
```java
// Pipe for users list request
ActionPipe<GetUsersAction> usersPipe = janet.createPipe(GetUsersAction.class);
// Pipe for repositories list request
ActionPipe<GetReposAction> repositoriesPipe = janet.createPipe(GetReposAction.class);
```

Action result is provided via `ActionState` observable:
```java
Observable<ActionState<GetUsersAction>> usersObservable = usersPipe.observe();
```

`ActionState` includes:
* state – `start`/`progress`/`success`/`fail`;
* action instance itself;
* progress value;
* exception for `fail` status

To send new action for execution:
```java
usersPipe.send(new GetUsersAction());
```

To combine sending and observing at once:
```java
usersPipe.createObservable(new GetUsersAction()).subscribe(...);
// every other pipe's observer will get result too
```

Other capabilities:
* observe latest cached result (aka replay(1)) or clear cache;
* observe success-only results;
* observe base parent actions; 
* cancel action execution;
* create safe read-only pipe forks to listen for results only;

### ActionService
`ActionService` is responsible for execution of particular actions. 
It defines what actions it's able to process, so `janet` knows where to route 'em.

Every service should override 3 methods:
* `getSupportedAnnotationType()` - defines what actions are processed by their class annotation;
* `<A> void sendInternal(ActionHolder<A> holder)` – is called upon new action is sent to pipe;
* `<A> void cancel(ActionHolder<A> holder)` – is called upon action is canceled from pipe;

There are several services to look at:
* Simple impl. -> [CommandActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-command);
* Complex impl. -> [HttpActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-http).

### ActionServiceWrapper
Decorator for `ActionService` is used to listen for action status or add additional intercepting logic.

Abilities:
* Listen for action flow by statuses;
* Intercept sending completely;
* Intercept fail-status to start a retry;

Simple logging wrapper:
```java
public class LoggingWrapper extends ActionServiceWrapper {

    public LoggingWrapper(ActionService actionService) {
        super(actionService);
    }

    @Override protected <A> boolean onInterceptSend(ActionHolder<A> holder) {
        System.out.println("send " + holder.action());
        return false;
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptCancel(ActionHolder<A> holder) {
        System.out.println("cancel " + holder.action());
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptStart(ActionHolder<A> holder) {
        System.out.println("onStart " + holder.action());
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptProgress(ActionHolder<A> holder, int progress) {
        System.out.println("onProgress " + holder.action() + ", progress " + progress);
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptSuccess(ActionHolder<A> holder) {
        System.out.println("onSuccess " + holder.action());
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptFail(ActionHolder<A> holder, JanetException e) {
        System.out.println("onFail " + holder.action());
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

@Provides Janet createJanet() {
    return new Janet.Builder()
        .addService(new LoggingWrapper(new HttpActionService(API_URL, httpClient, converter)))
        .build();
}
```

Examples:
* Authorize requests via [AuthWrapper](https://github.com/techery/janet-architecture-sample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/techery/sample/service/AuthServiceWrapper.java)
* Log requests via [TimberWrapper](https://gist.github.com/almozavr/ccf620b4c0041552a8b8dbb2204254cb)

Possible solutions: caching middleware, `Dagger` injector, retry policy maker, etc.

## Janet benefits
1. Flexibility and scalability. Scale functionality using [services](/janet/src/main/java/io/techery/janet/ActionService.java);
2. Reactive approach for actions interaction by [RXJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava);
