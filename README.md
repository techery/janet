## Introduction
Janet provides the infrastructure to build a flexible, scalable and resilient 
architecture based on actions, `RxJava`-powered pipes and the services to execute these actions.
You can learn more about our framework from this [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/dirong/janet-build-command-based-architecture-in-reactive-manner) 
  
Let's walk through a common flow for the http request: 

![overview](/assets/readme-overview.png)

* Janet is equipped with services to deal with different actions:
    ```java
    Janet janet = new Janet.Builder()
        .addService(new HttpActionService(API_URL, httpClient, converter))
        .addService(new SqlActionService(...))
        .addService(new XyzActionService(...))
        .build();
    ```
    
1. Our request is described with the `SampleHttpAction` class:
    ```java
    @HttpAction(value = "/demo", method = GET)
    public class SampleHttpAction {
        @Response SampleData responseData;
    }
    ```
    
    The request is sent/observed with its `ActionPipe`:
    ```java
    // create pipe for action class with janet
    ActionPipe<SampleHttpAction> actionPipe = janet.createPipe(SampleHttpAction.class);
    
    // register request result observer
    actionPipe.observe().subscribe(new ActionStateSubscriber<SampleHttpAction>()
        .onStart(action -> System.out.println("Request is being sent " + action))
        .onProgress((action, progress) -> System.out.println("Request in progress: " + progress))
        .onSuccess(action -> System.out.println("Request finished " + action))
        .onFail((action, throwable) -> System.err.println("Request failed " + throwable))
    );
    
    // send request
    actionPipe.send(new SampleHttpAction());
    // or actionPipe.createObservable(new SampleHttpAction()).subscribe(...) 
    ```
2. The request is forwarded to the `Janet` instance upon the `send` or `subscribe` call;
3. `Janet` finds a suitable service to execute an action and routes to it;
4. `ActionService` knows how to deal with the action and sets up the `progress`/`success`/`fail` statuses;
5. The resulting action is brought back to the `Janet` instance;
6. `Janet` routes the resulting action with a status to the dedicated pipes;
7. The dedicated `ActionPipe` notifies all its observers of the action wrapped with a current status;

So the `Janet` instance itself stands for routing and delegating the diff job to other components:

* `ActionPipe` – an action operator, the only way to send an action and receive a result;
* `ActionService` – knows how to deal with an action;
* `ActionServiceWrapper` – a decorator to add additional logic to the underlying service;

### Available services
The Janet abilities depend on services.
Currently, they include the following:

* [HttpActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-http) to enable the HTTP/HTTPS request execution;
* [AsyncActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-async) to provide support for async protocols, e.g. [socket.io](http://socket.io/);
* [CommandActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-command) to delegate any job back to the command `action`.
   
Possible solutions: 
`SqlActionService`, `LocationActionService`, `BillingActionService`, etc.

## Components
### ActionPipe
The only way to operate with `action`is via its `ActionPipe`.
It's created for a particular action class:
```java
// Pipe for users list request
ActionPipe<GetUsersAction> usersPipe = janet.createPipe(GetUsersAction.class);
// Pipe for repositories list request
ActionPipe<GetReposAction> repositoriesPipe = janet.createPipe(GetReposAction.class);
```

An action result is provided via the `ActionState` observable:
```java
Observable<ActionState<GetUsersAction>> usersObservable = usersPipe.observe();
```

`ActionState` includes:
* state – `start`/`progress`/`success`/`fail`;
* action instance itself;
* progress value;
* exception for the `fail` status

To send a new action for execution:
```java
usersPipe.send(new GetUsersAction());
```

To combine sending and observing at once:
```java
usersPipe.createObservable(new GetUsersAction()).subscribe(...);
// every other pipe's observer will get result too
```

Other capabilities:
* observe the latest cached result (aka replay(1)) or clear cache;
* observe success-only results;
* observe base parent actions; 
* cancel an action execution;
* create safe read-only pipe forks to listen to results only;

### ActionService
`ActionService` is responsible for execution of particular actions. 
It defines what actions it's able to process, so `janet` knows where to route 'em.

Every service should override 3 methods:
* `getSupportedAnnotationType()` - defines what actions are processed by their class annotation;
* `<A> void sendInternal(ActionHolder<A> holder)` – is called when a new action is sent to the pipe;
* `<A> void cancel(ActionHolder<A> holder)` – is called when an action in the pipe is canceled;

There are several services to look at:
* Simple impl. -> [CommandActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-command);
* Complex impl. -> [HttpActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-http).

### ActionServiceWrapper
A decorator for `ActionService` is used to listen to the action status or add the additional intercepting logic.

Abilities:
* Listen to the action flow by statuses;
* Intercept sending completely;
* Intercept the fail status to start a retry;

A simple logging wrapper:
```java
public class LoggingWrapper extends ActionServiceWrapper {

    public LoggingWrapper(ActionService actionService) {
        super(actionService);
    }

    @Override protected <A> boolean onInterceptSend(ActionHolder<A> holder) {
        System.out.println("send " + holder.action());
        return false;
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptCancel(ActionHolder<A> holder) {
        System.out.println("cancel " + holder.action());
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptStart(ActionHolder<A> holder) {
        System.out.println("onStart " + holder.action());
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptProgress(ActionHolder<A> holder, int progress) {
        System.out.println("onProgress " + holder.action() + ", progress " + progress);
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptSuccess(ActionHolder<A> holder) {
        System.out.println("onSuccess " + holder.action());
    }

    @Override protected <A> void onInterceptFail(ActionHolder<A> holder, JanetException e) {
        System.out.println("onFail " + holder.action());
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

@Provides Janet createJanet() {
    return new Janet.Builder()
        .addService(new LoggingWrapper(new HttpActionService(API_URL, httpClient, converter)))
        .build();
}
```

Examples:
* Authorize requests via [AuthWrapper](https://github.com/techery/janet-architecture-sample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/techery/sample/service/AuthServiceWrapper.java)
* Log requests via [TimberWrapper](https://gist.github.com/almozavr/ccf620b4c0041552a8b8dbb2204254cb)

Possible solutions: caching middleware, the `Dagger` injector, retry policy maker, etc.
